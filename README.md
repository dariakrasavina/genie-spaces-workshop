# Databricks Genie Agents Workshop — Manufacturing Quality Analytics

A hands-on workshop that teaches you to **build, curate, evaluate, and operate a production-ready Databricks Genie Agent** on manufacturing quality data — and to know when *not* to use one.

The core message: a Genie Agent is only as good as the **data foundation and curation** behind it. You'll build **three agents on the same data** and prove, with benchmarks, that curation is what earns trust:

- **[Baseline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/genie-agents/concepts#select-data)** — tables only (the "before")
- **[Metric View](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/uc-semantics/metric-views/)** — a governed semantic layer with pinned joins and KPI formulas
- **[Knowledge Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/genie-agents/tune-quality)** — measures, filters, fields, joins, synonyms, and example SQL (the "after", and your primary agent)

## What you will walk away with

- **A production-ready Genie agent** with a structured **Knowledge Store** (Notebook 04) — measures, joins, synonyms, and Q-to-SQL examples — instead of one brittle instructions blob.
- **A governed metric view** (Notebook 03b) that pins KPI formulas and joins in Unity Catalog — the "move the logic to the left" pattern.
- **Proof that curation matters** (Notebook 08) — the same hard questions run against baseline, metric-view, and Knowledge Store agents, side by side.
- **A repeatable evaluation workflow** (Notebook 05) — push benchmarks, run them in the UI, review failures with knowledge snippets, and iterate.
- **Security guardrails** (Notebook 09) — column masking with Unity Catalog, proving Genie respects row/column security.
- **Monitoring** (Notebook 10) and **CI/CD** (Notebook 11) for operating agents over time.

## Prerequisites

See **`PREREQUISITES.md`** for the full checklist. In short: a Databricks workspace with **Unity Catalog** and **Genie** enabled, a **Pro/Serverless SQL warehouse**, and privileges to `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE VOLUME`, `CREATE FUNCTION`, and `CREATE VIEW` (metric views) in a sandbox catalog/schema.

## Getting started

1. Import the **`notebooks/`**, **`templates/`**, and **`skill/`** folders into your Databricks workspace so they sit side-by-side:

   ```
   /Workspace/Users/<your_email>/genie-agents-workshop/
     notebooks/        ← 14 notebooks (00–12, includes 03b)
     templates/        ← Genie agent configuration (reference)
     skill/            ← Genie Code skill file
   ```

2. Open **`00_workshop_config`** and set your **catalog** and **schema**.

3. Run notebooks **01 → 12** in order. Every notebook reads your config
   automatically via `%run ./00_workshop_config`.

## Notebooks

| # | Notebook | What you will do |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 00 | **Workshop Config** | Set your catalog, schema, and preferences |
| 01 | **Load Data** | Create 7 manufacturing tables (plants, lines, operators, events, quality metrics, safety, feedback) |
| 02 | **Prepare Data** | Add table comments, create analytics functions |
| 03 | **Baseline Agent** | Create a tables-only agent — the "before" for comparison |
| 03b | **Metric Views** | Build a governed metric view (semantic layer) and an agent on top of it |
| 04 | **Knowledge Store** | Curate programmatically: measures, filters, fields, joins, synonyms, example SQL — the primary agent |
| 05 | **Benchmarks** | Push benchmark questions, run in the UI, fix failures with knowledge snippets and ground-truth updates |
| 06 | **Explore with Genie** | Ask questions in the Genie UI, verify with reference SQL |
| 07 | **Genie Code Skills** | Use a Genie Code skill and a prompt to create an agent — no API code needed |
| 08 | **3-way Compare** | Run the same hard questions on baseline vs. metric-view vs. Knowledge Store agents |
| 09 | **Security** | Column masking with Unity Catalog — prove Genie respects row/column security |
| 10 | **Monitoring** | Track accuracy, usage, and query performance over time |
| 11 | **CI/CD** *(optional)* | Promote Genie agents across environments with code |
| 12 | **Cleanup** *(optional)* | Remove all workshop assets (agents, metric view, tables, volume) |

## How the evaluation works

**Notebook 05** defines benchmark questions with ground-truth SQL and pushes them to the primary agent's **Benchmark** tab:

```
  Define benchmark questions with ground-truth SQL
                        │
                        ▼
            Push to Genie Benchmarks tab
                        │
                        ▼
        ┌──▶ Run in UI / Review failures
        │               │
        │               ▼
        │   Accept knowledge snippets /
        │       Update ground truth
        │               │
        │               ▼
        │         All passing?
        │          │        │
        │         No       Yes
        └──────────┘        │
                            ▼
                    Benchmarks green
```

**Notebook 08** proves curation matters by running the same four hard questions against all three agents:

```
            4 hard questions
                   │
                   ▼
  Run on Baseline, Metric View,
        Knowledge Store
                   │
                   ▼
    Compare pass rates side by side
                   │
                   ▼
     Baseline struggles;
     Knowledge Store wins;
     Metric View is deterministic
       within its perimeter
```

The benchmark questions **teach patterns** (state joins, ratio calculations, shift
aggregation). The four comparison questions in notebook 08 are intentionally
**different** — Genie must generalize from the curation, not memorize answers.

## Notebook-specific notes

- **07 — Skills:** Copy `skill/manufacturing-analytics_genie/SKILL.md` into your workspace's `.assistant/skills/` directory before running notebook 07.
- **09 — Security:** Replace `admin_group` with a real group in your workspace.
- **10 — Monitoring:** Queries `system.access.audit` and `system.query.history`; the notebook handles missing access gracefully.

## Compute

All notebooks run on **Serverless** compute. Classic clusters with Unity Catalog access also work.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Notebook 03 / 03b / 04 fails to create an agent | Check Genie entitlement, SQL warehouse availability, and API permissions. |
| Wrong catalog in Genie answers | Ensure notebook 00 has the same catalog/schema you used in 01–02. |
| `CREATE VIEW ... WITH METRICS` errors in 03b | Metric-view YAML syntax varies by workspace version — check the docs for yours. |
| Benchmarks in wrong UI tab | Notebook 05 pushes benchmarks inside `serialized_space.benchmarks` (the GA API), so they land in the Benchmarks tab. |

## License and data

Sample data is **synthetic** — generated for training and demos, not real
production or customer data.

## Credits

Adapted and extended from an earlier internal Databricks manufacturing Genie workshop. The Genie Agents modernization — terminology, audit fixes, the metric-view and Knowledge Store notebooks, and the three-way comparison — was added on top.
